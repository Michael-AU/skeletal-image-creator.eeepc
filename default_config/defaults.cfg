# Master config file for moblin-image-creator.  If you would like to override

# It is recommended that you do NOT put your changes in any of the files in
# /usr/share/pdk/default_config/, since they will be wiped out if you install a
# new package.
# 
# If you run /usr/share/pdk/lib/mic_cfg.py directly, it will print out the
# configuration information as it has parsed it.

# If you want to have configuration date for a specific platform, then you can
# specify a section name in the form of [platform.platform_name].  Otherwise
# the [platform] section will be used by default for any platform.
# Example: [platform.menlow] to have a section for the menlow platform
#
# Note: If you change any of the buildroot_mirror, buildroot_codename,
# buildroot_extras, buildroot_packages, target_mirror, target_codename, or
# architecture.  You will need to delete your current rootstraps for it to take
# affect. This command will do that:  image-creator --command clear-rootstraps

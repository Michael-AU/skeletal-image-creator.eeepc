  * Fixed a error where lib/modules link to target fs should be created every time, if not, when the first target
    fs is removed, then image creator could not generate correct initrd image anymore, since the symbol link
    points to non-existence dir.

  [ John L. Villalovos ]
  * Fix Bug 15.  Unable to delete the samsung target.  Discovered that the
    target is doing a mount of fs/lib/modules/2.6.22-8-generic/volatile to
    tmpfs.  Now we will attempt to do a umount if we get a resource busy
    error.
  * Minor tweaks to the fix for Bug 15

  [ Rusty Lynch ]
  * Adding some more basic gstreamers codecs

  [ John L. Villalovos ]
  * Fix for Bug 40, issue with src_regex being undefined

    This should fixes a bug where the initrd's didn't match the system nor
    entries in grub's menu.lst file which were generated by update-grub.

  [ Rob Rhoads ]
  * Fixing debian changelog to account for the following changes from Alek Du...
  * Needn't to keep target's /usr/share/pdk mount, since mksquashfs runs in
    project's jail root not target's
  * Keep /usr/share/pdk mounted while making squashfs, because mksquashfs needs
    the initramfs dir in /usr/share/pdk/platform/ ...
  * For menlow platform, our kernel-mid does not use libata yet. so the PATA
    dev nodes still are hda1 hda2, etc. So I have to modify disk scripts in this ugl
  * umount target fs's /proc & /sys file system before making squashfs, otherwize
    mksquash will encounter errors, since there are now not bind mounted. :-(
  * Add update-grub to image creator to generate menu.lst on the fly.

  [ John L. Villalovos ]
  * Allow the use of a ~/.image-creator/platforms.cfg file to set the
    buildroot_mirror, target_mirror.
  * Delete extra print output

  * Adding new --bypass-rootstrap command line argument to allow
    for the creation of project and target filesystems without
    using a cached rootstrap archive.

    users to clear out rootstrap files
  * Adding multiverse apt config files for mccaslin
  * Adding a feature where a failed debootstrap call will be retried
    for up to 10 ten times before giving up.  This helps get past
    spurious network issues that debootstrap will call a corrupt apt
    repository.

  [ John L. Villalovos ]

moblin-image-creator (0.4) gutsy; urgency=low

  [ Rusty Lynch ]
  * Changed the entry level script from 'project-builder
    to 'image-creator', and fixed a few random locations that
    were still using the old name.
  * Reworked the usb installation script, and the usb and disk initramfs
    scripts to work correctly with the ubuntu kernel now that the HD shows
    up as /dev/sda.  Also performed some cleanup in the early boot process.
  * Cleaning up the mccaslin base fset by removing references to the
    zi9, making the core fset use the ubuntu 386 kernel and removing the
    previous 'ubuntu-flavored-core'
  * Removing local apt repository code from both menlow and mccaslin
    platforms since it has proved itself to not be needed and as a
    result was just complicating the build process
  * Adding 'umount-project' and 'umount-target' command line options
  * Adding 'run-project' and 'run-target' command line options
    that allow for arbitrary execution of commands in either the buildroot
    or target root file-system
  * reworked the pdk_utils.exeCommand command to use the normal stdout/stderr
    when an output array is not passed in.
  * reworked the mccaslin base fset to fit with packaging changes from the
    ubuntu gutsy sprint

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * Add a Depends on bzip2.
  * Add restricted to the default list of sources.list.
  * Make the Samsung Q1 image use linux-generic, not linux-image-generic.  This
    should enable more of the hardware.

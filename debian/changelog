moblin-image-creator (0.4) gutsy; urgency=low

  [ Rusty Lynch ]
  * Changed the entry level script from 'project-builder
    to 'image-creator', and fixed a few random locations that
    were still using the old name.
  * Reworked the usb installation script, and the usb and disk initramfs
    scripts to work correctly with the ubuntu kernel now that the HD shows
    up as /dev/sda.  Also performed some cleanup in the early boot process.
  * Cleaning up the mccaslin base fset by removing references to the
    zi9, making the core fset use the ubuntu 386 kernel and removing the
    previous 'ubuntu-flavored-core'
  * Removing local apt repository code from both menlow and mccaslin
    platforms since it has proved itself to not be needed and as a
    result was just complicating the build process
  * Adding 'umount-project' and 'umount-target' command line options
  * Adding 'run-project' and 'run-target' command line options
    that allow for arbitrary execution of commands in either the buildroot
    or target root file-system
  * reworked the pdk_utils.exeCommand command to use the normal stdout/stderr
    when an output array is not passed in.
  * reworked the mccaslin base fset to fit with packaging changes from the
    ubuntu gutsy sprint

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * Add a Depends on bzip2.
  * Add restricted to the default list of sources.list.
  * Make the Samsung Q1 image use linux-generic, not linux-image-generic.  This
    should enable more of the hardware.

moblin-image-creator (0.4) feisty; urgency=low

  * Changed the entry level script from 'project-builder
    to 'image-creator', and fixed a few random locations that
    were still using the old name.
  * Reworked the usb installation script, and the usb and disk initramfs
    scripts to work correctly with the ubuntu kernel now that the HD shows
    up as /dev/sda.  Also performed some cleanup in the early boot process.
  * Cleaning up the mccaslin base fset by removing references to the 
    zi9, making the core fset use the ubuntu 386 kernel and removing the
    previous 'ubuntu-flavored-core'

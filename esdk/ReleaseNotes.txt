		     Project-Builder
		------------------------------
		      Release Notes

Release: pre-alpha
Milestone: 2


Description:
============
Project-builder is a development tool written in Python and GTK to aid in the
development of Platform-specific installable images.

The way it works is simple.  The tools builds on simple yet powerful concepts
which are:
*Projects: These are the dedicated root-jails for development of a Platform
specific feature(s) in an isolated environment to prevent contaminating the
developer's workstation especially during build, compile, install and
unit-testing.  The Developer utilizes the "chroot" tool to work in a project.

*Targets: These are the directory and file system structure (root file system)
that will eventually be installed and contains the applications and binaries
intended to run on the end platforms -- defined here as the Target.

*Fsets: Function Sets are categories defining functionality executed on the
target platform.  For example, Core is the base OS and is fundamental to
booting the system -- it includes the kernel and supporting packages.  Also
there are Networking, Power-Management, X and more.

Building on these concepts, the Project-builder shal provide developers with all the
tools to develop, build and produce run-time and installable images for the
targeted platform.

What's in this release:
=======================
*GUI: A graphical front to all the Project-builder classes and tools.
*Project-builder: the main application, by default will bring up the GUI but
accepts command line arguments to create projects and targets and also install
FSets.
*Bundeled FSets: core, Power-Management, Networking and more to get you
started with real and usable components.
*Create LiveUSB image to boot off of a USB key with a Live filesystem in
memory.
*Create InstallUSB image to install target filesystem and fsets onto target
system from USB key.

Known Issues:
=============
*Several issues with the GUI such as "Enter" key in Text entry fields does not
act as intended action to complete entry.  Will be fixed in next release.
*Create LiveISO and InstallISO are not implemented yet.
